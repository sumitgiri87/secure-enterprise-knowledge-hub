# Secure Enterprise Knowledge Hub (ECKH)

## Overview
Secure Enterprise Knowledge Hub (ECKH) is a **security-first, enterprise-grade conversational AI platform** designed to provide safe, compliant, and auditable access to internal organizational knowledge using Generative AI.

The system enables employees to query internal documents (policies, handbooks, technical docs, knowledge bases) through a conversational interface while enforcing **strict security guardrails**, **access controls**, and **continuous adversarial testing**.

ECKH is built to reflect **real enterprise AI deployment constraints**, not a toy chatbot.

---

## Problem Statement
Large organizations face significant challenges when adopting GenAI for internal knowledge access:

- Sensitive internal data risks leakage via prompt injection or model misuse
- Lack of governance, auditability, and compliance controls
- Vendor lock-in with single-model deployments
- No systematic red-teaming or safety evaluation of AI systems
- Limited visibility into AI behavior, failures, or policy violations

Traditional chatbots fail to meet **enterprise security, compliance, and reliability requirements**.

---

## Solution
ECKH provides a **secure, cloud-native conversational knowledge platform** that:

- Retrieves answers from approved internal knowledge sources using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Enforces **policy-based guardrails** to prevent PII leakage, confidential data exposure, and unsafe outputs
- Supports **multi-provider LLM routing** with failover across cloud AI platforms
- Performs **automated AI red-teaming and adversarial testing** in CI/CD
- Produces **audit logs and security telemetry** suitable for enterprise monitoring and compliance

## Key Features

### 🔐 Security & Compliance First
- Prompt injection and data exfiltration mitigation
- PII detection and output filtering
- Policy-based response enforcement
- Structured audit logs for all LLM interactions

### 🤖 Enterprise-Grade GenAI Architecture
- Multi-cloud LLM support (Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, extensible)
- Vendor-agnostic model gateway (LiteLLM / Portkey)
- Secure API layer with authentication and rate limiting

### 🧠 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Vector-based semantic search over internal documents
- Metadata-aware document chunking
- Access-level tagging (extensible for RBAC/ABAC)

### 🧪 Continuous AI Red-Teaming
- Automated prompt attack simulations using Promptfoo
- Policy violation and guardrail effectiveness testing
- CI/CD-integrated safety regression testing

### 📊 Observability & Governance
- Request-level telemetry and metrics
- Guardrail violation tracking
- Model routing and fallback analytics

---

## Architecture Overview

**High-Level Flow:**

1. User submits a query via secure API
2. Authentication and request validation enforced
3. Query passes through policy and guardrail checks
4. Relevant documents retrieved via vector search (RAG)
5. LLM response generated via model gateway
6. Output validated against security policies
7. Response delivered with full audit logging

See `architecture/architecture-diagram.png` for the detailed system diagram.

## Technology Stack

### GenAI & Orchestration
- Azure OpenAI (primary LLM provider)
- Anthropic Claude (fallback / secondary)
- LiteLLM or Portkey (model gateway and routing)

### Backend & APIs
- Python, FastAPI
- RESTful secure endpoints

### Retrieval & Data Layer
- LangChain / LlamaIndex
- Vector database (Pinecone, Milvus, or FAISS for local demo)

### Guardrails & Safety
- Guardrails AI or NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails
- Custom policy engine
- PII detection modules

### Red-Teaming & Testing
- Promptfoo (automated adversarial testing)
- Custom prompt injection and misuse scenarios
- GitHub Actions CI/CD

### Observability & Security
- Structured JSON logging
- OpenTelemetry-compatible metrics
- SIEM-friendly audit logs

---

## Threat Model (Summary)
ECKH explicitly addresses the following threats:

- Prompt injection attacks
- Sensitive data exfiltration
- Model hallucination of confidential content
- Unauthorized access to restricted knowledge
- Silent policy drift in model behavior

Detailed analysis is available in `architecture/threat-model.md`.

## Metrics & Outcomes (Demonstrative)

In a representative enterprise deployment scenario:

- ~40% reduction in time spent locating internal policies
- 0 successful PII leakage incidents during adversarial testing
- >90% of common internal queries handled without human escalation
- Continuous detection of prompt-based attacks via automated testing

## Why This Project Matters
This project is intentionally designed to mirror **how enterprises actually deploy GenAI**:

- Security-first, not model-first
- Governance and observability built-in
- Continuous evaluation instead of one-off demos
- Cloud-agnostic and vendor-flexible

It demonstrates practical experience at the intersection of:
- AI Platform Engineering
- AI Security & Governance
- Enterprise Cloud Architecture

---

## Future Enhancements
- Fine-grained RBAC/ABAC integration (Azure AD / IAM)
- Data residency and retention controls
- Model risk scoring dashboards
- Integration with enterprise SIEMs and ticketing systems
